### 🔹 Day 2: Constructors, Access Modifiers & Class Design

#### 📚 Learning Objectives

* Understood the concept of **constructors** in Java and their role in object initialization
* Learned the difference between **default constructors** and **parameterized constructors**
* Gained clear understanding of **access modifiers** (`public`, `protected`, `private`, default)
* Learned about **instance variables** and how they differ for each object
* Understood **class variables (static variables)** shared across all objects
* Practiced **encapsulation** using private variables with getters and setters
* Strengthened understanding of **inheritance** and controlled data access

---

### 🧪 Java Programs & Practice Work

* Created multiple Java programs using **constructors**
* Solved problems based on:

  * Parameterized constructors
  * Initializing objects using constructors
  * Instance vs class variables
* Implemented programs demonstrating **access modifiers**
* Solved scenario-based problems such as:

  * Book Library System
  * Bank Account Management
  * Employee Records
  * Vehicle Registration
  * Online Course Management
* Created **subclasses** to demonstrate:

  * Use of `protected` members
  * Controlled access to `private` variables using getters/setters

---

### 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used

* **Java (OOP Concepts)**

  * Constructors
  * Instance variables
  * Class (static) variables
  * Access Modifiers
  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance
* **Eclipse IDE**

  * Package-based project organization
  * Class and constructor creation
  * Debugging and execution
* **Git & GitHub**

  * Continued work on `java-oops-practice` branch
  * Added multiple constructor-based programs
  * Followed structured commits for daily practice

---

### ✅ Best Practices Followed

* Applied **least privilege principle** while using access modifiers
* Kept sensitive data **private** and accessed via getters/setters
* Used `protected` only where inheritance required controlled access
* Maintained **clear constructor logic** for object initialization
* Followed proper **Java naming conventions**
* Organized code using meaningful **packages and class names**

### 🔹 Day 3: `this`, `static`, `final` Keywords & `instanceof` Operator (Level 1 Lab Practice)

#### 📚 Learning Objectives

* Understood the purpose and usage of the **`this` keyword** for:

  * Referring to current class instance variables
  * Differentiating between instance variables and parameters
  * Improving constructor and method clarity
* Learned the **`static` keyword** and its role in:

  * Creating class-level variables and methods
  * Sharing data across all objects of a class
* Gained clarity on the **`final` keyword** and its usage with:

  * Variables (constant values)
  * Methods (preventing method overriding)
  * Classes (preventing inheritance)
* Understood the **`instanceof` operator** to:

  * Check object type at runtime
  * Support safe type casting and inheritance-based logic
* Got introduced to **Eclipse Editor features** for efficient coding and debugging

---

### 🧪 Java Programs & Practice Work

* Implemented **Level 1 lab practice programs** based on:

  * `this` keyword usage in constructors and methods
  * `static` variables and static methods
  * `final` variables, methods, and classes
  * `instanceof` operator with parent–child class relationships
* Solved problems demonstrating:

  * Difference between instance and class members
  * Shared data across objects using static members
  * Immutability and restriction using final keyword
  * Runtime type checking using instanceof
