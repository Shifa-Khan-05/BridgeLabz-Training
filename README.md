## 📅 Week 3 – Day 1: Linked Lists Using Java

On **Day 1 of Week 3**, I focused on **Data Structures (Linked Lists)** using Java.
The session involved understanding **node-based storage, pointer manipulation, traversal logic**, and solving **real-world scenario-based problems** with Linked Lists.

## 🧠 Best Practices Applied

* Maintained **head & tail pointers** for efficient access
* Performed **null checks** before operations
* Ensured **O(1)** insertion/deletion at ends
* Handled edge cases (empty list, head/tail manipulations)
* Prevented infinite loops in circular lists
* Clean pointer updates & memory safety
* Modular and readable method design
