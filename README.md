# 📘 BridgeLabz Training – Java Design Patterns Practice

## 📘 Week 7 – Day 1: Design Patterns | Smart University Library Management System

On **Day 1 of Week 7**, I worked on a **real-world, scenario-based application** to understand how **multiple design patterns can coexist** in a single system.
The focus was on **scalability, consistency, loose coupling, and extensibility** using core Java Design Patterns.

## 🧠 Design Patterns Applied

### 🔹 Singleton – Centralized Library Catalog

* Ensured only **one instance** of `LibraryCatalog` exists across the campus
* Prevented inconsistencies in book data
* Provided a global access point for catalog operations

---

### 🔹 Factory – Dynamic User Creation

* Created users at runtime based on role:

  * Student
  * Faculty
  * Librarian
* Centralized object creation logic
* Improved flexibility and maintainability

---

### 🔹 Observer – Book Availability Notifications

* Allowed users to **subscribe for book availability**
* Automatically notified multiple users on catalog updates
* Ideal for waitlists and new arrival alerts

---

### 🔹 Builder – Flexible Book Construction

* Built `Book` objects with optional attributes:

  * Authors
  * Editions
  * Genres / Sub-genres
  * Publisher details
* Avoided complex constructors
* Improved readability and extensibility

---

## 🛠️ System Highlights

* Centralized catalog management
* Role-based user handling
* Real-time notification mechanism
* Flexible and clean object creation
* Integrated mini-project using multiple patterns
