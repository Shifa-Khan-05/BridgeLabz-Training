# 📘 BridgeLabz Training – Java I/O Streams

## 📘 Week 5 - Day 1 : CSV Data Handling & File Processing in Java

During **Week 5  - Day 1 **, I worked on **CSV-based data processing systems** using **Java I/O Streams**, **Collections**, and **Regex**.
The focus was on **reading, writing, validating, transforming, and securing CSV data**, including **large-file handling and real-world integrations**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Applied

* **File I/O** – FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter
* **CSV Parsing & Processing**
* **Collections** – List, Map, Set
* **Regex** – Data validation (Email, Phone)
* **Object Mapping** – CSV ↔ Java Objects
* **Performance Optimization** – Chunk-based file reading
* **Data Security** – Encryption & Decryption
* **Data Transformation** – CSV ↔ JSON
* **Exception Handling** – Fault-tolerant processing

---

## 🛠️ Practice Problems Implemented

### 🔹 Basic CSV Operations

* Read CSV file and print records in structured format
* Write employee data to CSV file
* Count records excluding header row

---

### 🔹 Intermediate CSV Processing

* Filter students scoring **> 80 marks**
* Search employee details by name
* Update salaries (+10%) for IT department
* Sort employees by salary (descending) and display top 5

---

### 🔹 Advanced CSV Handling

* Validate CSV data using Regex:

  * Email format
  * 10-digit phone numbers
* Convert CSV rows into Java objects (`List<Student>`)
* Merge two CSV files using a common ID
* Detect duplicate records based on ID
* Read **large CSV files (500MB+)** using chunk processing
* Generate CSV reports from database records
* Convert **JSON ↔ CSV**
* Encrypt sensitive fields (Salary, Email) while writing
* Decrypt data while reading

---

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

✔ Built robust CSV processing pipelines
✔ Applied regex for real-world data validation
✔ Handled large files efficiently
✔ Converted data across formats (CSV, JSON, Objects)
✔ Implemented secure data handling
✔ Strengthened file-based system design skills

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Java I/O Streams**
* **Java Collections**
* **Regex**
* **JSON Processing**
* **Eclipse IDE**
* **Git & GitHub**

## 📘 Week 5 – Day 2: JSON Data Handling & File Transformation in Java

On **Day 2 of Week 5**, I focused on **JSON data processing using Java IO Streams and Jackson**, working on **object–JSON conversion, validation, filtering, and format transformation**.
The emphasis was on **real-world data workflows**, **data integrity**, and **multi-format processing (JSON, CSV, XML)**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Applied

* JSON parsing and generation using **Jackson**
* Java Object ↔ JSON conversion
* Reading and writing JSON files using IO Streams
* Filtering and transforming JSON data
* Schema-based validation
* Cross-format conversion (JSON ↔ CSV ↔ XML)
* Real-world data sanitization and reporting

---

## 🛠️ Practice Problems Implemented

### 🔹 JSON Fundamentals

* Created JSON objects (Student with subjects array)
* Converted Java objects (Car, Student) to JSON
* Read JSON files and extracted selective fields
* Merged multiple JSON objects/files
* Converted lists of Java objects into JSON arrays
* Filtered records (e.g., age > 25)
* Validated JSON structure and email fields

---

### 🔹 Advanced Data Processing

* Printed all keys and values from JSON files
* Generated JSON reports from database records
* Converted CSV data into JSON
* Converted JSON data into XML
* Applied schema-based validation for structured data

---

## 🏏 Case Study: IPL Match Censor Analyzer

### 📌 Problem Overview

Built a **Java application** to read IPL match data from **JSON and CSV files**, apply **censorship rules**, and generate sanitized outputs.

### 🔍 Censorship Rules Applied

* Masked team names

  * Example: `Mumbai Indians → Mumbai ***`
* Redacted player names

  * Example: `MS Dhoni → REDACTED`

### 📤 Output

* Generated **censored JSON files**
* Generated **censored CSV files**
* Preserved data structure while sanitizing sensitive fields

### 🧠 Key Learnings from Case Study

✔ Multi-format file handling (JSON + CSV)
✔ Regex-based string masking
✔ Safe data transformation and rewriting
✔ Real-world compliance-style data processing

---

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

✔ Strong understanding of JSON processing in Java
✔ Hands-on experience with Jackson APIs
✔ Built end-to-end data transformation pipelines
✔ Learned to handle structured & semi-structured data
✔ Improved confidence in real-world IOStream use cases
