# 📘 BridgeLabz Training – Java 8 Programming Practice

## 📘 Week 6 – Day 1: Java 8 Features | Streams, Lambdas & Interfaces in Action

On **Day 1 of Week 6**, I practiced **core Java 8 features** by solving **real-world, scenario-based problems**.
The focus was on **Stream API**, **lambda expressions**, **functional interfaces**, **interface enhancements**, and **method references** to build **clean, expressive, and functional-style Java code**.

---

## 🧠 Java 8 Concepts Applied

* **Stream API** – filtering, mapping, sorting, grouping, aggregation
* **forEach()** – iteration with lambdas
* **Functional Interfaces** – Predicate, Function, Runnable
* **Lambda Expressions** – behavior-driven logic
* **Interfaces** – abstraction, default & static methods
* **Marker Interfaces** – tagging behavior
* **Method References** – cleaner functional syntax

---

## 🛠️ Stream API – Scenario-Based Problems

* Top 5 trending movies using `filter()`, `sorted()`, `limit()`
* Doctor availability filtering and specialty-based sorting
* Insurance claim analysis using `groupingBy()` & `averagingDouble()`
* Filtering gym memberships expiring in next 30 days
* Transforming and alphabetically displaying customer names

---

## 🔁 forEach() – Real-Time Operations

* Stock price logging
* Event attendee welcome messages
* IoT sensor readings above threshold
* Email notification broadcasting
* Transaction logging with timestamp

---

## 🧩 Interfaces & Functional Interfaces

### 🔹 Interface Design

* Smart device control (`turnOn()`, `turnOff()`)
* Vehicle rental system
* Digital payment abstraction

### 🔹 Functional Interfaces

* Temperature alert system (`Predicate`)
* String length checker (`Function`)
* Background task execution (`Runnable`)

---

## ⚙️ Interface Enhancements

### 🔹 Static Methods

* Password strength validation
* Unit conversion utilities
* Date formatting helpers

### 🔹 Default Methods

* Refund support in payment gateways
* JSON export in reporting modules
* Smart vehicle dashboard extensions

---

## 🏷️ Marker Interfaces

* Data serialization for backup
* Object cloning using `Cloneable`
* Sensitive data tagging for encryption
